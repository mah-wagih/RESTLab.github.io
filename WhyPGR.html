                                    The requirements are (1) <b>interest in RF electronics</b>, with some knowledge; (2) a related <b>1st Class degree</b> (including EEE, MechE, CS, and Physics); and (3) <b>drive and passion</b> to do novel engineering and communicate it to the world.<br>
                                    
                                    <br> In addition to the regular benefits of a PhD from a top-100 worldwide University, here are some aspects unique to a PhD in REST working with <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/mahmoudwagih/">me</a>.

                                    <!-- A PhD is <em>NOT</em> a period of under-paid employment! While advertised as a 37.5-hour working week, time spent in Doctoral training can have additional career (and even financial) benefits beyond you Â£16k tax-free stipend. <br> <br> -->
